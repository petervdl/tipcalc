This is a one screen tip calculator.

Written by Peter van der Linden, second week of June 2014.

License - you're free to re-use this code for anything you like, but you must credit
          me as the original author.

Functions:

    User can enter a check total, and the desired tip %.
    App calculates the tip on that amount, and displays:
         - formatted tip amount
         - total amount including tip

Gotchas:
    If someone wants to split a bill N ways, when N is not a perfect divisor of
    the bill, the app will round up everyone's share, a penny at a time, until
    it is a perfect divisor.   How many other tip apps catch that case, and get 
    it right?

Extras
    0.  Actions are accompanied by sound effects and tactile effects.
        After you are sufficiently entertained, turn them off with the
        loudspeaker image button (top right of app screen).
    1.  User can use ^ v (up/down arrows) to change tip %
    2.  User can select how many ways to split the tip
    3.  User can edit tip percentage, and it persists across launches
    4.  Used Image buttons in several places
    5.  Put a lot of effort into UI with color scheme, nice font, good icons
        (the pale green color is to match many standard bill forms)

Screen capture
    There is an animated GIF showing the app running in file lc-tip.gif
    GIF was created with the excellent LiceCap screent capture app.
